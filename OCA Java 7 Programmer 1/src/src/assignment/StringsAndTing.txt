* Strings and tings

String objects are used to represent 16 bit unicode strings

String quote = "Dead men tell no tails";
	- This creates a new String
	
String doesnt change after the value is changed

	- Strings are immuable modification creates a new String
	
	quote.replace("No Tails","Tales");
	System.out.println(quote);
	--- Dead Men Tell No Tails
quote was not assigned after a new string was created. 


String quote1; // reference variable with no assigned object
quote1 = "Ahoy Matey" assigns string object to the refference

String quote2 = new String //reference variable
String quote2 = new String(""); // same statement
String quote3 = "a String with no constructor";
String quote4 = new String("A string using a constuctor")

*String Concatenation Operator
 	- + = String Concatenation Operator
 	
 	String item  = "doubloon";
 	String question = "What is a "+question+" ?";
 	
* The toString method

the object class has a method that returns a string representation of object
this is the toString method, all java classes inherit this method, 
good practice is to override this method to best show represent the data. 

* the charAt method

-returns a primative char value for a specified int

* indexOf Method
-returns primative int values representng the index of a character
can be a int for the indexchar or can be a char

* the length method
	- the primative int for the number of charaters in a String

** EXAM WATCH **
 - The String class uses the length)() method 
 - Arrays used array.length with no brackets
 
*T The Concat method
 - the concat method concatenates the specified String to the end of the original String
