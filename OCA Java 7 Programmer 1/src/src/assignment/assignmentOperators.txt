- Programming Java Operators and Strings

Understanding Fundamental Operators

- Assignment Operators
- Arithmetic Operators
- Relational Operators
- Logical Operators

* Assignment Operators
this is the equals sign (=)
Assignment operators cause compiler errors when literals are not valid. 

*Compound Assignment Operators
  += Assignment by addition
  -= Assignment by subtraction
  
  goldCoins - goldcoins +99;
  pirateShips - pirateShips - 1;
  
  goidcoins +=99;
  pirateShips -=1;
  
- Good practice is to use longhand as its more readable

*Arithmetic Operators

There are 9 arithmetic operators

 - + Addition
 - - Subtraction 
 - * Multiplication
 - / Devision
 - % Modulus
 - ++X prefix increament
 - --X prefix decrement 
 - X++ postfix increment
 - X-- postfix decrement
 
 
 * Relational Operators
 
 - < Less than
 - <= less than or equal to
 - > greater than
 - >= greater than or equal 2
 
 * Equality Operators
 - == Equal to operator
 - != Not Equal operator
 
 *Numeric Promotion of Binary Values
 
 if one operator is double, float or long convert to double float or long
 else convert to int
 
 *Logical Operatrs
 - AND &&
 - OR  ||
 - NOT !=
 
 !!!true = false
 !!!!true = true
