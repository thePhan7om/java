* INSIDE THE EXAM

Exam designers took the time to work corner cases to appear to be correct
code but is not. 

* Enchanced for loop
 
 Used to iterate a collection or array or any object that implements the
 iterable interface. loops can be terminated with the break statement

the while loop statement evaluates an expression and executes the while loop bosy
only if the expression evaluates to true
