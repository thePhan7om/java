* Terminating Threads

- When the run method has finished executing the thread terminates, this is the normal 
way to terminate a thread- implement the run method so that it returns when it determines
no more work needs to be done. 

- A Thread terminates when the run method terminates

Sometimes it is neccisery to terminate a thread. 

terminating threads can lead to dangerous situations where threads share resources. 

Thread needs to release any resources it is using and do some clean up to notify a thread
to terminate and clean up use
	- t.interupt();
		- doesnt actually terminate thread it sets a boolean flag that the run method checks 
		
		- if a thread is sleeping it cant execute code to check for interuptions therefor 
		the sleep method is terminated
