*Race Condidtions

When threads share access to a common object they can conflict with each other, 
To Demonstright the problems that can arise we will investicate a simple program
create 2 sets of threads

	- Each thread in the first set deposits $100
	- Each thread in the second set withdraws $100
	
public run 
{
	try
	{
		for(int i =1; 1<= count i++)
		{	
			account.deposit(amount);
			Thread.sleep(DELAY);
		}
	}
	catch (InteruptedException e(){}
	}
	

public void deposit(double amount)
{
   System.out.print(“Depositing” + amount);
   double newBalance = balance + amount;
   System.out.println(“, new balance is” + newBalance);
   balance = newBalance;
}

Thread-1	Thread 2	Value
-				-			0
read			-			0
-				read		0
increment		-			0
-				increment	0
write			-			1
-				write		1

the expected result should be 2
