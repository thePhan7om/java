* XML Tags And Documents

- XML allows you to encode complex data independent of any programming language in a form that
a recipient can easily parse

- XML files are readable by a computer and by humans
- XML formatted data files are resilient to change

- XML describes the meaning of data not how to display them

- An XML Document starts out with an XML declaration and contains elements and text

* Parsing XML Document

- A Parser is a program that reads a document, checks whether it is syntactically correct and takes some action

- A Streaming Parser reports the building blocks of an XML Document, a A Tree- based parser builds
a document tree

- A DocumentBuilder can read an XML document from a file, URL or input Steam, the resultant object becomes a tree

- An Xpath describes a node or node set using a notation similar to that of directory paths

-	/item/item[0]/quantity

-The Document Interface has methods to create elements and text nodes

* Validating XML

- a DTD Document Type Definition is a sequence of rules that describes the valid child elements and attributes of each 
element type
	- valid attributes
	- valid child elements
	
	- DTDs cannot force an element to be of a type only text string
- Schema is like a DTD but has more precise rules. 
- for each element you specify the element and type for example this constrains to a int
<xsd:element name="quantity" type="xsd:integer"/.

you can specify object types in a schema

<xsd:compleType name="Address">
	<xsd:sequence>
		<xsd:element name="name" type = "xsd:string"/>
	</xsd:sequence> 
</xsd:complexType>
