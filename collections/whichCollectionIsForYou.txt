* How to Chose a collection

* Determine how you access the values
	- By Integer Postion - ArrayList
	- By Key that is not part of the Object - Map
	- Values accessed by first in first out - Queue
	- Values accessed by last in first out - Stack
* Determine the element type or key/value type
	- For a list or set determine the type of the elements you want to store
* Determine whether element or key order matters
	- when visiting elements for a collection or keys from a map do we care about order
	 	- Elements or keys myst be sorted - TreeSet,TreeMap
	 	- Elements mst be the same order as when inserted, - LinkedList, ArrayList
	 	- Order doesnt matter - HashSet,HashMap
*Determine which operations must be fast
	- Find Elements fast - HashSet
	- Add or remove at beginning or end, LinkedList
	-Only Insert or remove from the end so speed isnt effected ArrayList
*For HashSets and HashMaps decided wheather you need to implement hashCode and equals
	- if elements belong to another class check it has its own hashCode and equals
	- if not determine how you want to compare the elements by identity, if you never
	construct 2 distinct elements with the same contents do nothing
	- else create your own methods
* If using tree do you need to provide a comparaitor
