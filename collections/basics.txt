Collections

- Java collections framework is one of the standard librarys
- a hierarchy of interface types and classes for collecting objects each interface type is implemented 
by one or more classes. 

			<<Interface>>							         		<<Interface>>
		     Collection								    			     Map
		        
	<<Interface>>	<<Interface>>	   		   <<Interface>>			HashMap	TreeMap
		List			Queue			 	      Set
ArrayList	Stack	LintedList	PrioriryQueue	HashSet TreeSet


-- A list is a java collection that remembers the order of its elements

-- A Set is an unordered Collection of unique elements - No Dups
	-- Sets are faster than lists as it doesnt care about the order of things

-- Another way to gain efficiency is to reduce the number of operations, 
	-- A Stack remembers the order but doesnt allow to insert elements anywhere other than at the start
	-- A Queue adds elements to the end and removes them from the top

-- A Map keeps associates between key and value objects 
	- Barcode = key Book = value
