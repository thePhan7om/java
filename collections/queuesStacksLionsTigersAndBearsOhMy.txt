* Stacks, Queues, Priority Queues (The Things you never use)

* Stacks
	- A Stack is a collection of elements with first-in last-out retreval
	
	- A Stack lets you insert and remove elements only at one ends called top of the stack
		- Undo is a Stack operation
	
- Stack Methods
	-push
	-pop
	-peek - look but dont remove

* Queues
	- A Queue is a collection of elements with first-in first-out retrieval
	
	a typical application is a print queue. 
	- LinkedList implements Queue

- Queue Methods
	-push
	-pop
	-peek - look but dont remove

* Priority Queues
	- When Removing an element from a queue the most urgent priority is removed. 
	A Priority Queue collects elements each of which has a priority, 
		- Example a collection of work requests most important work is done first. 
		
		PriorityQueue<WorkOrder> q = new PriorityQueue<WorkOrder>();
		q.add(new WorkOrder(1,"do important thing");
		q.add(new WorkOrder(2,"Order Stuff");
		q.add(new WorkOrder(3,"cleanthing");
		
		- calling q.remove removes the one the lowest priority value i.e the most important thing.
