* Internet Application Summary 

	* Describe the architecture of a web application
		- UI of a web application is displayed in a web browser
		- When a form is submitted, the names and values of the form elements are sent to 
			the server
		-Upon receiving the form data, the web server sends a new web page to the browser
	* Describe the architecture of a JSF application
		- JSF pages contain HTML and JSF tags
		- JSF Container converts JSF tags to HTML 
		- A managed bean is an object that is controlled by the JSF container
		- A Bean with session scope is available for multiple requests by the same browser
		- the JSF technology enables the separation of presentation and business logic
	* Explain how properties are defined in managed beans and accessed in value expressions
		- properties of software component can be accessed without having to write java code
		- JavaBeans is a class that exposes properties through its get and set methods
		- In the value expression of an output tag, only the property getter is called
		- in the value expression only the input tag the setter is called
	* Navigation between pages
		- The outcome String of an action determines the next page that the container sends
		to the browser
		- the method expression specifies a bean and a method that should be invoked on the bean
	* Use common JSF components for designing a user interface
		- There are JSF components for input choices buttons and images
		- the value attribute of an input component denotes the value the user supplies
		- the f:selectItems tag is to specify all choices for a component
	* Developer applications that use JSF and a database
	- 3 tier application has separate tiers for presentation, logic and data storage
	- you define data sources in the JSF container and use resource annotations to initialise them
