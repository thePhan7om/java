* Separation of Presentation and Business Logic

	- The JSF technology enables the separation of presentation and business logic
		- Presentation is the UI 
		- Business Logic is backend stuff
	
* Deploying a JSF Application
	- To run a JSF application you need a web server with a JSF container
	
* Javabeans components

	- A Software component is an entity the encapulates functionality and can be plugged
	into a software system without programming, a managed bean is an example of a software 
	component
	
	- A Javebean is a class that exposes properties through its get and set methods
	
	- A Javabean  must have a constructor with no arguements
	- A Javabean must have methods for accssing the component properties that follow
	the get/set naming convention
	
	- the value expression of an output tag only the property getter is called
	- in the value expressions of an input tag the property setter is called when the page
	is submitted
	
* Navigation between pages

- THe outcome string of an action determines the next page that the JSF container sends 
to the browser

- A method expressions specifies a bean and a method that should be invoked on a bean
