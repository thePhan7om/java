* Architecture of a Web Application

- A Web application is an application whose user interface is displayed in a web browser

- The browser sends a request to the server using HTTP, when a user clicks a link the 
request is simply asking for the page attached to the link

	Get /index.html HTTP/1.1
	Host: host.com

When the user fills data in a form and clicks submit an HTTP request includes the data 
that the user provided

Upon receiving the form data the web server sends a new web page to the browser


* Architecture of a JSF Application

- a JavaServerFaces JSF page contains HTML and JSF tags

- The JSF Container converts a JSF page into an HTML page by replacing all 
JSF Tags with text and HTML tags

	- The purpose of a JSF page is to generate an HTML page, the basic process is
		- HTML tags present in the JSF page are retained, these are static parts
		- JSF Tags are translated into HTML. this translation is dynamic, it depends on 
		the state of java objects that are associated with the tags
		
	Browser requests a JSF page, processed by an JSF Container, which converts it to a 
	HTML file sent by the web server over the internet and rendered on the users web browser
	
* Managed Beans

#{timeBean.time} is a value expression, value expressions invoke method calls on java objects
these java objects are called Managed Beans

- A Managed bean is an object controlled by the JSF Container
	the JSF container creates a Managed Bean when it is first used in a value expression. 
	the scope of the managed bean determines which clients can access the object and how long 
	the object will stay alive. 
	
-A SessionScoped bean is one which is available for multiple requests by the same browser
